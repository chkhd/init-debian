# TODO: use file provisioner to deploy additional files to the guest,

## This depends on the fact that the keys would have been already
## copied by Vagrant. This is defined in the Vagrantfile.
cd ~vagrant

## Copy the keys for use by root as well, most installation is run as

mkdir ~root/.ssh

## Register SSH keys for commonly used stuff and things that are used
## during installation
